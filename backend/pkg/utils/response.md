### Here's a guide on when to use each function:

1. WriteSuccessResponse:

- Use this when your API operation completes successfully.
- Ideal for GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE operations that execute without errors.
- Example: After successfully retrieving a user's profile or creating a new resource.

2. WriteErrorResponse:

- Use this for general error scenarios that aren't validation or internal server errors.
- Good for client errors like 404 Not Found, 401 Unauthorized, or 403 Forbidden.
- Example: When a requested resource doesn't exist or a user doesn't have permission to access it.
  
3. WriteValidationErrorResponse:

- Use this specifically for input validation errors.
- Typically used with a 400 Bad Request status.
- Example: When a user submits a form with invalid data (e.g., invalid email format, missing required fields).

4. WriteInternalErrorResponse:

- Use this for unexpected server-side errors.
- Always sends a 500 Internal Server Error status.
- Example: Database connection failures, unexpected panics, or any error that's not the client's fault.

5. WriteJSONResponse:

- This is a more flexible function for cases not covered by the others.
- Use when you need to send a custom status code or a response that doesn't fit the success/error pattern.
- Example: Sending a 201 Created status with custom data after creating a resource.

#### General tips:

- For typical CRUD operations, use WriteSuccessResponse for success cases and WriteErrorResponse for error cases.
- Always use WriteValidationErrorResponse when the error is due to invalid input from the client.
- Use WriteInternalErrorResponse sparingly, and make sure to log the actual error for debugging.
- When in doubt or for very specific needs, fall back to WriteJSONResponse for full control over the response.
